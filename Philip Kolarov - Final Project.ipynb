    "### Abstract\n",
    "In the realm of demographics, the replacement fertiltiy level for a country is usually described as a constant. The general interpretation is that in order to maintain one's population, ignoring certain factors, a state must have a total fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman. While there are good reasons for this, it might help to be a little more accurate than this when looking at specific countries, as each nation deals with its own unique circumstances. In this article we will be looking at whether Bulgaria's replacement fertility level should be slightly different, based on recent population trends and research in other countries."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "Before we start analyzing current and recent trends, it is important to understand the different concepts we are using. Here is a list of all the key terms we will be using throughout this article:\n",
    "* net migration\n",
    "* growth rate\n",
    "* (period) life expectancy\n",
    "* infant mortality rate\n",
    "* total fertility rate\n",
    "* replacement fertility rate\n",
    "* (mean) age of childbearing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at each term individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Net Migration\n",
    "Net migration refers to the \"net total of migrants\" throughout the year. In other words, if we take the number of immigrants ($I$) and subtract the number of emigrants ($E$), we will end up with the net migration ($NM$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ NM = I - E $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Growth Rate\n",
    "A country's growth rate ($GR$) is a percentage that shows the change in its population from the previous year ($P_{p}$). The change itself is depentdent on three variables - number of births ($B$), number of deaths ($D$), and net migration ($NM$). \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ GR = \\frac{(P_{p} + B - D + NM)}{P_{p}} - 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (Period) Life Expectancy\n",
    "This is an estimation of how long a person can expect to live. As there is more than one way to measure this however, we will be using the definition for period life expectancy. This is a projection of the average lifespan of a person born in a certain year based on the \"death rates across all age groups\" in that same year. It assumes that the age-specific death rates from that year will remain constant throughout the newborns' lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Infant Mortality Rate\n",
    "Infant mortality rate ($IMR$) is a probability of a newborn child dying within the first twelve months of its life. Rather than being looked at simply as the number of deaths among newborns ($D_{nb}$) divided by the total of newborns ($B_{nb}$) for a given year, it is expressed as the number of deaths observed per every 1000 infants in that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ IMR = \\frac{D_{nb}}{B_{nb}} \\cdot 1000 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total Fertility Rate\n",
    "The total fertility rate in a given year is the \"total number of children that would be born to each woman\", assuming that she would survive all her fertile years and her births would be \"in alignment with the prevailing age-specific fertility rates\". Typically, age-specific fertility rates are gathered across different age groups of five year intervals (20-24-year-olds, 25-29-year-olds, etc.). However, some data attained is more accurate, going into every year idividually, as we shall see later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Replacement Fertility Rate\n",
    "The fertility rate that would ensure a stable population (ignoring migration and changes in mortality rates). As mentioned in the abstract, this number is generally considered a constant - 2.1 children per woman.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Age of Mothers at Childbirth\n",
    "Also known as mean age of childbearing ($\\bar{A_{m}}$), this is calculated by taking the sum of all mothers' ages at the point of their giving birth ($\\sum A_{m}$) across all births for that year($B$), no matter whether it is her first born or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{A_{m}} = \\frac{\\sum A_{m}}{B} $$"

   "source": [
    "### Population (1950-2023)\n",
    "Now that we have some understanding of the terms, let's see them in practice by looking at data collected by the United Nations from 1950-2023. First of all we have data for population, births, deaths and net migration. This will allow us to calculate in our own time the growth rate between two different years."
